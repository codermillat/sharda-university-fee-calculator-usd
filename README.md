The course data is managed in a single file with a clear schema. To add or update a course, edit this file following the `Course` interface.

```typescript
export interface Course {
  id: string; // Unique identifier (e.g., "btech-cse")
  title: string; // Full name of the course
  group: string; // The school or department (e.g., "SSET")
  durationYears: number; // Course duration in years
  years: number[]; // Array of tuition fees, one for each year
  scholarships: number[]; // Array of available scholarship percentages (e.g., [50, 20])
  notes?: string; // Optional notes
}

// Example:
{
  id: "btech-cse",
  title: "B.Tech. Computer Science & Engineering (CSE)",
  group: "SSET",
  durationYears: 4,
